### Why does this guide exist?

This material was developed during DeFiHack 2026: Uniswap Unlocked with the purpose of democratizing access to the new digital economy. Our mission is to simplify complex technology, allowing the long-sought financial freedom to be put into practice.

Imagine you want to exchange your local currency for dollars to travel. In the traditional world, you must go to a bank or an exchange house, accept the set rate, fill out forms, present documents, and wait for the intermediary’s approval. In this case, the bank owns the process.

In Decentralized Finance (DeFi), we have a global market, open 24/7, where there are no managers, queues, or bureaucratic registrations. People exchange assets directly with each other—you are "the owner of the bank." Everything happens through an automatic and transparent system.

### But who guarantees security?

This is where the technology behind it all comes in: the Blockchain, a complex encrypted system. The blockchain is secure because there is no way to erase or alter what has already been written; it functions as a public ledger where everyone can see what is happening. This allows you to trust the mathematics of the system's cryptography without depending on third parties.

This is the world of Decentralized Finance (DeFi), and the Uniswap Wallet will be your gateway in this guide. It is the application that combines effective technology with modern usability, similar to popular mobile apps. Through this tool, you can send, receive, and swap crypto assets, interacting with the DeFi universe simply.

With the Uniswap Wallet you experience self-custody, this means you are solely responsible for your money. There are no intermediaries storing your passwords, controlling your funds, or limiting your financial movements.

### Why does this matter?

- You in control: Your money stays "in your pocket" (in your digital wallet), not in a bank account.
- Borderless: You can send value to other countries or to a neighbor with the same ease.
- Transparency: All rules are clear and equal for everyone.

### What is in this guide?

We will go from zero to your first interaction in the DeFi world.
You will learn how to:

- Create your "account" (which is actually an encrypted private key).
- Perform your first cryptocurrency swap in seconds.
- Navigate safely, without falling into common traps.
