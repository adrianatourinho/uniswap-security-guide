# Module 02: Swapping Tokens (Swap)

If you have made it this far, you already have your digital vault configured. Now, let's use it for its main function: swapping crypto assets within the blockchain (On-Chain). In the world of decentralized finance, we call this exchange a swap.

### The initial trigger: how does the money get here? (Buy button)

Before making any exchange, a common question is: "How do I put my Reais into this app?”

The blockchain does not understand what a R$ 50.00 bill or a traditional TED transfer is. It only understands digital codes. Therefore, we need to perform a conversion at the entry. It is like going to an amusement park: you hand over Reais at the ticket office and receive chips (Tokens) to use on the rides.

Inside the Uniswap app, there is a Buy button. By clicking it, you do not buy digital assets (Tokens) from Uniswap, but from integrated partners called "On-Ramps."

The process is simple:

- You define the amount and pay in Reais (PIX or Card) to this regulated partner (e.g., MoonPay or Topper).
- Automatically, the partner converts the value and deposits Digital Dollar (USDC) or Ethereum (ETH), for example, into your Uniswap Wallet.
- At that moment, the digitalization of money happens: the value leaves your bank account and is sent to your public address on the blockchain.

This video shows how to initiate an entry conversion, transforming Reais into USDC (digital dollar). The transaction confirmation step is not included.

### Curiosity: What happens behind the scenes?

As we saw previously, those who perform this conversion are the partners called On-Ramps. It works like a digital exchange house:

- You send Reais to this partner company (a regulated fintech).
- It validates the receipt of your money and unlocks the equivalent amount in crypto assets (tokens) that were already in its vault.
- It sends these tokens directly to your Public Address (that key we learned about in Module 1).

From the moment the balance appears in your Uniswap Wallet, that money is already on the blockchain (On-Chain). It is no longer in a traditional bank. It is now a token (crypto asset), registered on the blockchain (ledger), and only your private key can move it from there.

### Understanding the swap robot

In the Uniswap Wallet, you do not trade with people, nor with a company. You trade directly with a computer program called smart contracts. Through these programs, you negotiate directly with a giant pool of funds. The technical name for this is Liquidity Pool.

How does this pool work? Think of a pool divided in half. It does not have water; it is full of tokens.

- On the left side: Millions of USDC tokens.
- On the right side: Millions of ETH tokens.

The exchange (swap): When you want to exchange your USDC for ETH, the movement is automatic:

- You "pour" your USDC (digital dollar) into the pool (left side).
- The Smart Contract calculates the value and allows you to withdraw the equivalent amount in ETH (right side).
- The exchange happens in seconds. You "pay" with one digital currency and receive another in return.

> But who filled this pool? It was not Uniswap. It was thousands of people around the world (called providers) who deposited their coins there to ensure there is always change for you.

### Fees (gas fee)

To perform a swap, you use the blockchain infrastructure. Every action registered on it has a cost, and this cost is called the gas fee. It is basically the fee you pay for your transaction to be processed and confirmed on the network.

### First swap

Performing a swap on the Uniswap Wallet is as easy as sending a message:

- Tap the Swap button. Select the currency you have (e.g., USDC) and the one you want (e.g., ETH).
- The app will show you how much you will receive from the pool.
- If it is the first time you try to exchange a currency (like USDC), the app will ask for an "Approve" before letting you trade.
    - What is this? It is like unlocking the safe. You are signing a contract saying: "I authorize Uniswap to move my USDC balance." You only need to do this once per currency.
- The Swap: after approving, the final swap button appears. Slide to confirm..
- Done! In a few seconds, the transaction is written on the blockchain and your balance updates.

This video shows the path to the swap, selecting the currencies and defining the value you wish to exchange. The transaction confirmation step is not included.

### Security: Beware of Copies

Since Uniswap is open, anyone can create a cryptocurrency and put it there. This includes coins with the same names as the best-known ones (fake token scam).

- In the Uniswap app, look for tokens that have the correct colorful logo.
- Unknown or suspicious tokens usually appear with an alert icon ⚠️ or without an image (gray).
- When in doubt, do not buy.

### Mission: The Uniswap Multiverse

So far, you have used Uniswap on the main network (Ethereum), where the exchange fee (gas fee) can be expensive. But the Uniswap Wallet protocol works on several different blockchains simultaneously.

Your goal: to find out where to run when the fees on the main network are high. On these other blockchains, the same transaction can cost cents.

The Challenge:

- Access the official Help Center: [support.uniswap.org](http://support.uniswap.org/)
- Search for "Network" or "Chains.”
- Identify in the list which other networks (blockchains) are supported.

> Look for names like Arbitrum, Optimism, or Polygon. Knowing how to navigate between these networks is the secret to paying much cheaper fees in the future with the same security.
