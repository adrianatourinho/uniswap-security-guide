# About the Author

I live in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil, and at 29 years old, I have been building my professional path in the technology field, with a focus on digital security.

I am passionate about technology, I work as a cybersecurity analyst, and I have a great interest in topics related to blockchain, DeFi, and the evolution of Web3. For the coming years, I seek to specialize in security focused on Web3 applications and ecosystems, uniting technical knowledge with digital education.

I joined Defiverso with the initial goal of deepening my studies in blockchain. The experience in this project was a milestone in my journey, serving as a starting point to direct my career toward the field of security applied to decentralized environments.

This guide emerged as a way to make this universe more accessible to the general public, simplifying technical concepts and creating a clear and safe gateway for those who wish to understand and use decentralized technologies with more confidence.

Currently, I am in the final semester of the Cybersecurity Management and Defense program at UNINTER, where I complement my academic background with practical experiences and projects focused on digital security education and awareness.
