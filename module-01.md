# Module 01: Setting Up Your First Wallet

If you have ever used a banking app, you will find the Uniswap Wallet familiar. It has a balance, a statement, and a button for transactions. However, behind the beautiful interface, it works in a completely different way.
To start, we need to debunk a myth: your digital wallet does not store your cryptocurrencies. That is right. The coins live on the blockchain. Your wallet only stores the cryptographic key that gives you the right to move those coins.

### The PIX Analogy (To understand the concept of Keys)

To simplify, let's compare it to the PIX key, which everyone in Brazil knows. In the DeFi world, you have two main pieces of information:

- Public key (Wallet address): it is like your PIX Key. You can send it to anyone, and people use it to send you money.
- Private key (Seed Phrase): It is like your bank password. You never show this to anyone, not even to a manager or support.

Understanding the image: on the left side (pink side), the blockchain is represented, an environment in which the private key remains exclusively under your control. It is the element that authorizes and signs transactions, functioning similarly to your biometrics or password in a banking app (purple side); only you can use it.

The public key (receiving address) of your digital wallet can be compared to your PIX key; it is the information you share with third parties to receive values without compromising the security of your account or the control of your assets.

### The 12 words: your cryptographic private key

When you download the Uniswap Wallet app and click on "Create new wallet", it will not ask for your email, ID, or a 6-digit password.
It will show you 12 words in English (such as avocado, blue, chair, piano...). This is called a Seed Phrase or Recovery Phrase.

> Attention: These 12 words (private key) are your access to all your digital money.
> 
> - If you lose your phone but have the words, you recover everything on another phone.
> - If you lose the words, the money is lost forever.
> - If someone sees these words, they can have access to everything, even without your fingerprint or facial recognition.

Remember: this video is for demonstration purposes only. Never, under any circumstances, share your seed phrase (recovery key) with anyone.
