# Glossary

**Airdrop**
Free distribution of tokens to users, usually as a form of marketing, reward for using a platform, or incentive for adopting a protocol. Legitimate airdrops never ask for your seed phrase or private key.

**Approve**
Permission you grant to a smart contract to spend or move a specific token from your wallet. This authorization can be limited or unlimited and, if misused, can allow a malicious site to drain your funds.

**Malicious Actor / Attacker (Cracker)**
A person or group that performs actions with the intent to exploit, deceive, or cause harm to users and systems. In the DeFi context, they may use social engineering, phishing, or malicious smart contracts to steal funds or sensitive information.

**Self-Custody**
A model in which you are solely responsible for your crypto-assets, without depending on banks or exchanges. This means that only you control your private keys and your seed phrase, assuming full responsibility for the security and access to your funds.

**Blockchain**
A digital, public, and distributed ledger that records all transactions in a transparent and immutable way. Each new block of data is linked to the previous one, forming a chain that can be verified by anyone on the network.

**Private Key**
A secret code that proves you are the owner of your crypto-assets. Whoever possesses this key has total control over the wallet's funds. It must never be shared.

**Public Key**
An address that you can share to receive crypto-assets. It works like a visible "account" on the blockchain, while the private key is the password that allows moving the funds.

**Crypto-assets / Token**
Digital assets recorded on a blockchain. They can represent money, access to services, governance rights, or other types of value within a decentralized ecosystem.

**DeFi (Decentralized Finance)**
An ecosystem of financial applications that works without intermediaries, such as banks or brokers, using smart contracts on the blockchain to allow loans, exchanges, and investments directly between users.

**Social Engineering**
An attack technique that exploits human behavior, such as trust, fear, or urgency, to induce the victim to reveal information or perform actions that compromise their security, without the need to exploit technical flaws.

**ETH (Ether)**
The native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain. It is used to pay transaction fees (gas fees) and interact with smart contracts and DeFi applications within the network.

**Gas Fee**
A fee paid for a transaction or interaction with a smart contract to be processed on the blockchain. It works as the "computational cost" of the network and is typically paid in ETH on the Ethereum network.

**Liquidity Pool (Pool de Liquidez)**
A reserve of tokens locked in a smart contract that allows other users to perform swaps automatically. Those who provide liquidity can receive fees as a reward.

**Ledger** 
A record where all transactions are stored. In the blockchain context, it is the public and distributed history that shows who sent, who received, and when each operation occurred.

**On Chain**
Everything that happens directly on the blockchain and is recorded on the public ledger, such as transfers, swaps, and interactions with smart contracts. These actions can be verified by anyone.

**On Ramps**
Services that allow converting traditional money (such as Reais or Dollars) into crypto-assets, facilitating the entry of new users into the DeFi ecosystem.

**Phishing**
A fraud technique in which a malicious actor creates websites, emails, or messages that imitate legitimate services to deceive the user and get them to provide sensitive information or sign malicious transactions.

**Seed Phrase (Frase Semente)**
A set of 12 or 24 words that works as the "master key" for your wallet. With it, it is possible to recover all funds and addresses. Anyone with access to this phrase has full control over your wallet.

**Smart Contracts**
Programs that run on the blockchain and execute rules automatically when certain conditions are met, without the need for intermediaries. They are the foundation of DeFi applications.

**Swap**
The direct exchange of one token for another within a DeFi application, usually performed through a liquidity pool and a smart contract.

**Wallet (Digital Wallet)**
An application or device that stores your private keys and allows you to send, receive, and interact with crypto-assets and DeFi applications. It can be self-custody or controlled by third parties.

**Web3**
The "new phase" of the internet based on blockchain, where the user has more control over their own data, identity, and digital assets. Instead of depending on companies or centralized platforms, in Web3 you interact directly with decentralized applications (dApps) using your own digital wallet, maintaining self-custody of your crypto-assets.

**Zero Trust** 
A security principle based on the rule: do not trust anything by default. Every request, link, message, or transaction must be verified, even if it appears to come from an official or known source.
