# Module 03: Cybersecurity & Best Practices

In Modules 1 and 2, we talked about the freedom of being your own bank. Now we need to talk about responsibility.

Unlike the traditional banking system, where the institution takes care of security for you, in Web3 security is active. This may seem difficult at first, but it will actually make all the difference. When you learn to identify the patterns of scammers, you become "immune" to most traps.

After all, most scams occur due to human error (clicking where you shouldn't, trusting someone you don't know). Knowing how to identify a scam before it happens is the only way not to fall for it.

I have separated here the most common scenarios you will encounter and how to neutralize them.

### The False Friend Scam (Social Engineering)

This is the most frequent attack because it does not exploit code flaws; it exploits human trust. Here, the cracker (malicious actor) does not attack the software; they attack the user. The goal is to create a scenario of urgency or authority to make you turn off your critical thinking and hand over your information voluntarily.

The classic scenario: the fake "support." You enter the official Uniswap Discord or Telegram to ask a question. Minutes later, you receive a private message (DM) from someone with the photo and name of an Admin. The person is polite and says: "Hello, we detected an error in your wallet. To avoid losing your funds, you need to validate your account at this link now.”

The Defense: Zero Trust:

- Official support never calls you in private. If someone messaged you first, it is a scam.
- Never type your 12 words (Seed Phrase) on sites sent via chat. No real support will ever ask for this.

### **The Visual Trap (Phishing and Malicious Signatures)**

This is the most dangerous technical combo. Phishing is the bait (a fake site identical to the original). The Malicious Signature is the hook (a smart contract you sign without reading).

The classic scenario: the malicious "airdrop." You see an ad on Google or Twitter: "Uniswap is giving away free tokens! Check if you won.”

- You click and enter a site identical to the official one (Phishing).
- You connect your wallet and click the "Claim Prize" button.
- Your wallet opens asking for permission. In a rush, you confirm.
- You were not receiving any prize. The fake site programmed that button to ask for a "spend" permission (Approve). By confirming, you authorized the attacker to withdraw the entire balance from your wallet.

The Defense: digital education:

- Never enter crypto sites by clicking on Google ads. Save the official site ([uniswap.org](http://uniswap.org/)) in your favorites and only use it.
- Before confirming any transaction, read what the wallet says. If you are "winning" a prize, why does the transaction ask for permission to spend or approve tokens? If you see this, reject it immediately; it is a scam.

### Mission: The Detective

The history of the crypto market is full of examples of fortunes lost, not because of technology failure, but because of human failure.

Your goal: investigate a real theft and identify what "weapon" was used by the criminal. You must find out if the attack happened via Social Engineering (the "friend/opportunity" scam) or Phishing (the fake site/permission scam).

The Challenge:

- Choose one of the cases below to investigate:
    - Option A: Search for "Ronin Bridge Hack fake job offer".
    - Option B: Search for "BadgerDAO Hack user interface".
    
> When reading the news, look for the "human details.”
> - In the Ronin case: did it involve a PDF file or a job interview? (What scam does this remind you of?)
> - In the BadgerDAO case: did it involve the site asking for strange permissions in the wallet? (What scam does this remind you of?)
